    <h1>Plate Storage</h1>

    <p>During Covid I bought 70kg worth of relatively cheap weights. For a while I had them stored in the hallway like this:</p>
<p>Not ideal. So I built this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/platestorage-finished.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In order to protect the wood (and because I like overengineering), I made some holders as well. This was the general idea:</p>
<p><img src="/img/adapter-sketch.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I modeled the holders for each of the weights, matching the exact radius of the plates.</p>

<p>Using my trusty Ender 3, I printed these:</p>
<p><img src="/img/adapter-finished-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/img/adapter-finished-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When installed it looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/platestorage-finished-outside.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/img/platestorage-finished-detail.jpg" alt=""></p>
