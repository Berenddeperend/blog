      <p>This was one of my earlier arduino projects. I started with connecting some soil moisture sensors to a plant.</p>

<p>Then I built a pretty crappy planter with the sensor built-in.</p>

<p>I wanted to do something more with this concept. I wanted a planter with a water compartiment and a pump, so I could water the plant without being there. These are some sketches:</p>
<p>I settled on this design:</p>

<p>At TRIMM we have these green mugs everywhere. Whenever I wanted to get myself a cup of coffee, I could also get my planty boy a refill.</p>
<p>The goal was to have the thing wifi-connected, but I never made it past a prototype. I did hook it up to an infrared remote controller though, which worked pretty well.</p>
