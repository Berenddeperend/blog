      <p>I made this website because I wanted one central place to showcase some of my projects. The blog you're reading right is static HTML generated with <a href="11ty">11ty</a>. I'm not using a theme, I've just slapped some CSS on it. It is hosted on a headless Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) which is stuffed away somewhere in a cabinet in my living room:</p>
<p>The computer running this website.</p>
<p>The blog is Dockerized along with some other projects (a Minecraft server, my Tetris clone, its backend, its database, and anything else I'll build in the future). One <code>docker-compose up</code> command fires up everything, which is really cool. I spent a few evenings trying to learn Traefik for my reverse proxy HTTPS needs, but honestly I had a really hard time figuring it out. <a href="Caddy">Caddy</a> proved to be a way easier alternative, I would definitely recommend it. This stack I'm using is probably overkill for what I want to archieve. I just wanted the experience of doing it the 'right' way. Hopefully having this system in place also makes it less of a big deal to upgrade/maintain. If you're reading this, it at least means it hasn't failed yet :)</p>
