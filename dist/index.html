      <h1>Nice to meet you.</h1>
<p>This is the website of Berend Swennenhuis. Frontend developer by day, frontend developer by night as well but asleep. I live in Enschede, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I like to dabble in woodworking, 3D-printing, guitar playing, IoT and fitness.</p>
<p>Other interests in which I don't actively partake include retro hardware (big fan of channels like LGR and the 8-Bit Guy), birds, skateboarding and Sea Shanty 2 from Runescape.</p>
