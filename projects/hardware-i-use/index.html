  <p>Nobody asked but here's a list of some of the cool things I bought. Inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">Wes</a>.</p>
<h3>Computer stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2020 M1 MacBook Air (16GB RAM, 250GB SSD)</strong>. Definitely the best laptop I've ever owned. It's passively cooled, fast, stays cool and has an amazing battery life. Pretty much all I could ask for. I do prefer the 15 inch screen of my old MacBook but I needed a new laptop and I was fed up with the fan noise needed to keep the Intel processor cool. At the time of writing, the 13 inch models were the only Apple Silicon laptops available.</li>
<li><strong>Keychron K2</strong> with red switches. Awesome keyboard, typing on it is a delight. In hindsight I'd rather have gone with the K8. The K8 is only slightly bigger but has a more traditional tenkeyless layout, making switching to other keyboards easier. I'm also curious about their low-profile switches. Maybe someday.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Master S2</strong>. Good mouse. A bit too heavy for my taste and I'm not a fan of OSX scroll acceleration, but you get used to it. Its free-scrolling wheel is awesome.</li>
<li><strong>LG 27UL850-W</strong> 4k 27 inch monitor. With just one usb-c cable I can take care of audio, video and charging.</li>
<li><strong>PHPstorm</strong> is my code editor of choice.</li>
<li><strong>Wacom Intuos 4 M</strong>. I don't draw much any more, but it has served me well over the years.</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB RAM</strong>. Hidden in a cabinet. Passively cooled with a heatsink enclosure. It's where I host <a href="/projects/this-website">this website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Synology DS218play</strong> with 2x 3TB in a mirror setup. Not sure what RAID that is. This machine is mostly fire-and-forget for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parkside mitre saw</strong>. I don't have it dialed in perfectly yet but it's a lot of fun to work with. Pretty scary too. It still feels somewhat wrong to use it unsupervised.</li>
<li><strong>Ender 3 pro</strong> 3D printer. I replaced the motherboard with a BigTreeTech board that has quiet motor drivers. The noises were driving me insane after a while so I fully recommend the upgrade. Creating and printing your own designs is extremely rewarding, and for 200-something euros it was definitely worth it for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workout stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decathlon <strong>barbell</strong>. Very cool, I still can't believe I have my own barbell.</li>
<li>70kg worth of (relatively) cheap cast-iron <strong>plates</strong>. I built a <a href="/projects/plate-storage">storage rack</a> for them.</li>
<li><strong>Pullup bar</strong>. Love it.</li>
<li>Homemade <strong><a href="/projects/squat-rack">squat rack</a></strong>.</li>
<li>2x25kg Duo-Tech <strong>adjustable dumbbells</strong>. Got a good deal on them and they're well worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Power Perfect 3</strong> shoes. I have shitty ankle mobility so having a raised heel really helps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Music stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fender Mexican Standard Telecaster</strong>. Still diggin' the color after a few years of owning it.</li>
<li><strong>Yamaha F310</strong>. A perfectly adequate cheap acoustic.</li>
<li><strong>Squire Affinity Jbass</strong>. Got it second hand, it's good enough for me. Rarely use it anymore as we stopped jamming during COVID.</li>
<li><strong>Roland Cube 40</strong>. Perfect for someone of my skill level.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super Soco TC</strong> electric scooter. It looks like a 60s cafÃ© racer. Perfect for distances that I dread to do by bicycle.</li>
<li><strong>Azor Schouwen</strong>. Inspired by the old 'path racer' bikes. Wooden fenders, leather seat and handles, upside down handlebars, two speed centrifugal transmission. That's right, after reaching a certain speed it automatically shifts gears. Not gonna lie, I shamelessly stole this configuration from my coworker Erik. It's hands down the coolest bike I've ever seen.</li>
<li>An old racebike I bought second hand from my friend Joost. My preferred choice for rides outside of the city.</li>
<li>2000-something <strong>Honda Shadow 750 ACE</strong>. Really cool motorcycle. Unfortunately I don't get to use it as much as I'd like, as I live in the city center and can't easily park it near my house.</li>
</ul>
