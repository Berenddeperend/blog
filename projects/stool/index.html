<p>In September 2022 I joined a 12-week <a href="https://cursushout.nl/cursussen/particulier/houtbewerking-1/">woodworking course</a>. The first three weeks we practiced different types of joints, in the remaining nine weeks I built this stool. It took around 25 hours. The wood is 'grenenhout', which I believe is Scots Pine in English. It's made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortise_and_tenon">mortise and tenon</a> joints. I sawed, chiseled and sanded it by hand. A few exeptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the mortises were drilled with a horizontal drill press to save time.</li>
<li>The lumber was prepared for us with machines. I don't know which ones, but the wood was perfectly square.</li>
<li>The seat was also pre-made for us.</li>
<li>The seat isn't glued to the frame, it's secured by four brackets that are screwed in the seat. It's a pretty clever technique that I wasn't aware of before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Back at home I applied boiled linseed oil. It gave the wood a nice warm color and really made the grains pop.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the course to anyone in need of a new hobby. The folks over at CursusHout have been excellent. It's not cheap but well worth it in my opinion. Spend less on goods and more on services, y'all!</p>
<!-- To celebrate the completion of this project, I asked an AI to write a  love story about me and my stool.

<blockquote>
## The love seat <small>(By ChatGPT)</small>

Berend was a skilled craftsman who spent his days carefully crafting beautiful pieces of furniture from the finest woods. His greatest joy was creating hand-made wooden stools, each one unique and full of character.

One day, as Berend was working on a particularly intricate stool, he looked up and saw a beautiful woman named Elle walking by his workshop. She stopped to admire his work, and Berend was struck by her kind eyes and gentle smile.

From that moment on, Berend couldn't stop thinking about Elle. He worked tirelessly on his stools, pouring all of his love and passion into each one, hoping that one day he would be able to share them with her.

Finally, after months of work, Berend finished the most beautiful stool he had ever created. It was a work of art, with intricate carvings and a smooth, polished finish. Berend knew that this was the stool he had been destined to make, and that it was meant for Elle.

He nervously approached her and presented her with the stool. Elle was overcome with emotion at the sight of such a beautiful and thoughtful gift. She accepted the stool, and Berend's heart soared.

From that day on, Elle and Berend spent every moment they could together, sitting on the hand-made wooden stool, sharing stories and dreams, and falling deeper and deeper in love.

The stool became a symbol of their love, a physical manifestation of the passion and devotion that they shared. And as they sat on it together, they knew that they had found their happily ever after.
