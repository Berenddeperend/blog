<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Real-time co-op multiplayer over websockets</li>
<li>No login or other shenanigans necessary, just pick a nickname and play</li>
<li>Only has puzzles that are solvable without guessing/backtracking</li>
<li>Create new puzzles by drawing pixel art</li>
<li>Multiple input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch)</li>
<li>Auto x-es for better quality of life</li>
<li>A nice animation on puzzle clear for that extra dopamine boost</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In January 2021 I wrote Tetris in Typescript. This was one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had in programming. So in trying to chase the same high I wanted to write another game this year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram" target="_blank">Nonograms</a> are cool and websockets are also cool so I wrote Nonogram With Friends.
When I initially created Tetris without a framework I quickly realized how tedious it is to manipulate the DOM the old-fashioned way. That's why I wrote the frontend in Vue.js, a framework I've had a few years of experience with.</p>
<h2>Giving it to the internet</h2>
<p>Once I felt the game was in a presentable state I posted it to the /r/nonograms subreddit. The reddit has only 2500ish subscribers, so the chances of them DDOS'ing the Raspberry Pi it's hosted on were slim. Also I didn't need to explain them how nonograms work, saving me from having to write a tutorial. I posted a link to my game and eagerly waited for people to show up. Over the next few hours I had the pleasure of welcoming a few dozen people. At one time I was playing with 5 stranger simultaniously, which felt magical.</p>

<p>One stranger played for over half an hour straight. Another even took the effort to create a few new puzzles. Check out his cool elephant!</p>

<p>I'm very grateful everyone who stopped by that day.</p>
<h2>Improvement opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>An animation when successfully clearing a row or column.</li>
<li>An anti-spam system which prevents you from filling the puzzle with random blocks.</li>
<li>Arbitrary puzzle sizes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feature ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>A poll where you can vote on which of three puzzles to play next (showing only the puzzle title, so no spoilers)</li>
<li>A tutorial</li>
</ul>
<h2>Omissions</h2>
<ul>
<li>No chat system. Want to communicate? Aggressively point your cursor to the square you have an opinion about. Have others figure what you mean.</li>
<li>No private games or lobbies. We're all in this together!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>It took me a LOT of time to get from having all the services working locally, to having them all deployed in Docker behind a reverse-proxy. In the future I'd like to have all the services connected and working as early in the project as possible. Integration hell is real and tackling it when the codebase is still small is something I'd like to try next time. This would also allow me to publish my work earlier, which will probably work as a great motivator.</li>
<li>Don't needlessly separate the front- and backend into two repositories. My backend runs on the same Raspberry Pi that serves the frontend, which would enable me to serve it as a monolith. Both the front- and backend are written in Typescript and it would have been really nice to reuse some functions and types. Also, no CORS.</li>
<li>Make touchscreen support a first-class citizen instead of an afterthought. The types of games I've been making so far don't translate very well to mobile in my opinion, but I want to make something my mom would be able to play.</li>
<li>While Vue.js is a great framework for making UIs, I wouldn't write game logic in it again. Using computed properties for the cells is convenient but every time you fill in one cell, 99 cells needlessly execute code as well.</li>
</ul>
