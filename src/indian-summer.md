<a href="https://www.indiansummer-enschede.nl/" target="_blank">Indian Summer</a> is my favorite restaurant in Enschede. It's delicious, the dishes are sharable and it's surprisingly cheap. I often go there with different friends but I have a hard time remembering our favorite dishes. Hence this page.

## Main dishes

#### Butter chicken <small>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</small>
Combined with the Butter Naan it's the the bread and butter (ha!) of the Indian cuisine. This stuff is fire, yo. But not literally, it's very mild and sweet. Always make sure to order least this as one of your dishes.


#### Chicken chettinad
Pretty spicy, one of my favorites. Will order again.

#### Chicken Punjabi
I can't remember this dish but according to Maartje it's not too spicy but very tasty. Favorite of Joanne, Robin and Maartje.

#### Lamb laal maas rajasthani <small>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</small>
I know the meaning of 25% of those words. I also know that this is one of the spicier dishes (about 60% of Pinto Thai's Pad Ki Mau) and that it's a lot of fun to say Lamb Laal. If I were a rapper I'd definitely rhyme it with 'jeugdjournaal'. Educate them kids. Teach them about this dish.

#### Chola Masala (vegan)
Chickpeas, pretty good! The right amount of spice, according to Maartje.

#### Tikka Masala (vegan)
Not too impressive. The paneer tastes like cheese.

## Side dishes

#### Butter Naan <small>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</small>
Way less bread-like than the supermarket stuff. Can be quite rubber-ish if you have it delivered. Still a must-order.

#### Pappadum
I forgot what this is but it's one euro and that makes it worth it.
