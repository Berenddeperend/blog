After finishing Jaws of the Lion, we started playing Frosthaven. Sadly Robin moved to Braboland but we found an equally tall team member in Ramon. Meet the Frosti Tosties:

From left to right:

- 'Buurman' and 'Buurman' (me) as the **Geminate**
- 'Knuppelknul' (Ramon) as the **Drifter**
- 'Sanic' (Joost) as the **Blinkblade**
- 'Britney Spears' aka 'Stab Papi' (Maartje) as the **Banner Spear**


I only decided to do write-ups after the seventh campaign, so here are some highlights from our first seven campaigns, in no particular order:

- Maartje taking three(!) hours to unbox and sort the game.

- In the second campaign we got the help of a few NPC guards. Neat! But the first guard we met got killed so hard it wasn't even funny. We called him Spongebob for soaking up all that damage. Turns out he's even printed on the Frosthaven box!

- Maartje dying in like the fourth round, trying to hold of an army of eels and piranha pigs. Her sacrifice will be remembered.

<!-- - A sweet triple kill on three snow-imps by me, using Draining Pincers. -->

- Joost getting the shovel as a random item in our loot. It's way more helpful than it seems!

- Ramon got the Slippery sword, a hilarious item.

- Eels trying to destroy our ship named 'flapselhoeps'. They were stationary in the single water tile they spawned in, but one of them got something like a move 3 + jump and was able to jump to another water tile. It was a pretty funny thing to imagine. He didn't survive for long tho.

- Ramon staying a bit behind while we were chased by wolves. No worries though, the Drifter can catch up pretty easily with its walk bonuses. Unless a wolf would manage to bite his ankle and immobilize him. But that wouldn't happen, right?

- Joost staying extremely far behind to gather some more XP and loot afer we've practically finished the campaign. It turned out fine but it was a little risky. Had he died, we'd make him redo the campaign by himself.

- Maartje only had one potion while the rest of us had two or three. So we were nice enough to brew her a new potion using two mushrooms. Enjoy your champignonsoep.

A typical Frosthaven setup.

I absolutely love this game.
