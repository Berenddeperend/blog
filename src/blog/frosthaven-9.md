This week we took a magical elevator that hates Ramon in scenario 24: **Upper Spire**.

It was a really cool campaign full of extremes. Some highlights:

- I managed to target three enemies with my Firefly Swarm with the Hornbeetle Carapace active while consuming fire. A lot of silly words, but it means that I hit a 7, 6, and 8 for a combined **21 damage**. Beautiful!

- Chaos Demons were angry with me today! One of them hit me for a 6, then a 5. As revenge, I one-shotted him for 16 damage, while also completing my battle goal. ***Bonk.***

- We fought some skeletons and they were pretty useless. In one round, three of them tried to hit us and they all hit zeroes. Two curses and a miss, I believe. Skellyboiiii!

- A Wind Demon had three shield at some point, which is a pain to deal with. Luckily our comrad Bob was standing exactly where he should be, so Maartje could attack with three pierce damage. I don't know why but there's something very satisfying about having just enough pierce damage <3

- Joost ***granted*** walk?!! We were highly sceptical but there was no catch. Still can't believe it.

- Speaking of Joost, he had the absolute craziest luck that evening. Due to scenario effects and circumstances he had 4 extra curses and 2 extra blesses in his deck. He somehow managed to only draw 2x modifiers and zero x0 modifiers. This resulted in a few beautiful moves. He exactly one-shotted a few monsters, but also did 16 damage on an enemy who was already wounded, poisoned, and on 1 HP. Oh, *he dea!*

- Ramon was less lucky. We took a magical elevator that gives you a random effect (positive or negative) every time you enter. Ramon took trap damage from it twice. That's a 1 in 144 chance. The third time he entered he got wounded. Better take the stairs next time. 

And that was it! Next episode will be in a month because my friends have a life. How dare they.
