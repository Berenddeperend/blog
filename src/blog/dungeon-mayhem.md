An absolute banger. Robin (a.k.a. Jerry de Ferry) introduced me to the game and I must have played over a hundred games.
Special shoutout to our trip to Berlin where I first brought this game. Any time we would sit at a bar or beer garden we'd play a few rounds. Good stuff.

The base game comes with four characters.

- The base game is super quick to learn
- Surprisingly balanced. Every character shines in specific situations.
- Very pleasant artwork.
- Super portable and you can play it anywhere (like on a stranger's bicycle while waiting for a soccer game to start)

There's also two expansions which bring the total up to 12 characters, while being playable with 6 players. The DLC characters are great, but the balance suffers a bit from it.
Some characters hard-counter others and there is some power creep.
Also a few Mighty Powers make the behaviour of other Mighty Powers ambiguous. Like Delilah Deathray can redirect the damage of other player's attacks. But what if the Wizard Azzan then plays his Fireball (everyone take 3 damage)? Can Delilah combine all the damage and kill someone in a single blow?  
Still, it allows for a lot of new hilarious situations and is a nice addition to the base game. 

I made a wooden holder for the game as well:
