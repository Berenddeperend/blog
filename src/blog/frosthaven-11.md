This week we fell into a crypt in scenario 5: **Frozen Crypt**. But not before having Indian Summer for takeout. Classic!

We were chasing some snowy guy for reasons I don't remember. In our chase, we fell down a trap. Our objective this campaign was simple: bonk everything that moves until it doesn't.

In the final room there was an altar that keeps some snowy zombies alive. You can't hurt the zombies before destroying the altar. It looked pretty scary but wasn't all that difficult. Here's Maartje entering the final room:

Some highlights:

- We all wore bathrobes and Ramon wore Maartje's kimono. No pictures were taken, you'll have to believe me when I say we looked exquisite.  

- Remember how Maartje's character retired last time? Sike, she didn't! Well she did but she didn't have the energy to get acquainted with a new character so Britney and Bob joined us one last time <3

- I melee'ed an elite Ice Wraith that had retaliate. I bonk'd him pretty hard with my top card (Icebound Quills) but he still had 3 HP left.
So I had two options: use my bottom card to move into safety, or bonk for 2 damage and hope for a +1 modifier. I took a gamble, attacked and got lucky with the +1 modifier. Had my last attack not been killing blow, 
I'd suffered 2 retaliate damage again <i>and</i> he'd attack me for 4 damage + wound on his turn.

- Joost stayed behind to loot some more and walked 12 tiles in one round to catch up with us. Sanic!

- Joost did 14 damage in one hit: 3 base damage, two +2 modifiers, then a x2 modifier.

- Ramon did 24 damage in one turn. He did an area-of-attack where he hit all 4 enemies for 6 damage each.

- I got my battle goal of never leaving a room with loot tokens in it. Since this scenario only had two rooms with only 4 enemies in the first room, this wasn't too difficult. Two free checkmarks!

- The outpost event we encountered was hilarious and beautifully written. Even though we correctly predicted the most benefitial option, we went for the funny one:
