A good deck building game, pure and simple.

Some thoughts about the game:

- The theme of the game is about as generic as it gets. So generic in fact, that for the longest time I couldn't remember what this game was called.
- While it is a 1v1 game at heart, I appreciate that they also defined ways to play it co-op or 2v2.
- In a 2v2 game there is quite large balance shift. Because two players can pool their money, they can afford very strong end-game cards pretty much instantly. I feel that going for a strong eco isn't nearly as important as in a 1v1 game.
- The artwork is sort of inconsistent, which I find sort of funny. Special shoutout to this windows-98 quality render of a base <3

- The packaging contains ALL the colors.

- Annoyingly the game is just a little too large to fit in your pockets. It'll easily fit in any bag though.
- HP tracking with the two cards is a bit meh.
- Unlike Quacks of Quedlinburg, there is no rubber banding system. This means that if a player gets lucky enough to afford an expensive card early on, their win might be unpreventable. I've not played this game enough to confirm this though.
