This week we climbed to the top of the spire in scenario 34: **Top of the Spire**.

Time to kill the boss, baby! He is the Lord of Chaos and had a whopping 130 health, so there was plenty of spanking to be done.

The main mechanic of this scenario is that every time you enter the middle hexes of the room, the minions that get spawned by the boss will be able to hit you for extra damage. To reach the boss, you need to walk through the middle hexes. The boss also has a special ability that makes you move to the middle hexes. So the farther you get in the scenario, the more dangerous the minions become.

Some highlights:

- Maartje character loves people so she said our names eight times during a campfire and now she's retired. Honestly I think it's an excuse for her to get some more privacy with Bob.

- We were very lucky with enemy modifier deck again. It seemed like the enemy only drew 2x modifiers when they were disadvantaged, negating it.  

- The fight with the boss was pretty straightforward. So I went suicidal to harvest some more XP at the end of the campaign. I positioned myself in the middle of four sparky minions and used my Venomous Barbs card for 3 retaliate. Since I had already entered the middle hexes 5 times, the sparkies would hit me for 12 base damage each. I got hit for 13, 13, 13 and 12 damage. That's **51 damage** total, which has to be a record. But since throwing away a card to negate damage is a mechanic, I didn't take any damage at all and killed all four enemies with retaliation damage. Very silly and a lot of fun.

We killed the boss and got a korrel. We'll try to trade it for wood or something.
