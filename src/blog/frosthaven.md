Like [Jaws](/blog/jaws-of-the-lion) but turned up to eleven. Which in some aspects is a good thing, but I actually prefer Jaws.

Some pros:
- Cool new characters
- New status effects (bane, regenerate), rolling modifiers.
- New story branches are often unlockable by building a new vehicle, like a sled or boat. This is a really neat concept.

Some cons:
- The non-gameplay loop is too long. Resolving loot, road events, outpost events, base building, etc. This can easily take an hour after a scenario.
- The story feels all over the place because it's non-linear.
- cardboard generic map tiles are not as cool as Jaws' campaign-specific prints.
