Yee haw pardners!

Prehistoric shenanigans. Eat dodo's, get eaten by wolves, and prioritize drawing a painting over producing offspring.

- Thematically the best game I've played yet. All cards resolve in a way that feels believable. For instance there's a card that leads you to the forest. You can collect one wood and the card will be shuffled back into the deck. Or if you have the right tools, you can cut down the trees and collect three wood, but the card will be lost.
- The crafting table is so cool. It's purely cosmetic but I appreciate it a lot.

- The resources are cozy as well.

- I've read that after a few games you really learn how to optimize the game and then it stops being fun. I could see that happening, but after playing 4 or 5 campaigns I still enjoy it a lot.
- It's probably a little too luck-dependant for seasoned board game players, but I don't consider myself one of them. 
- I've played it with two, three and four players. More players seems to make it more difficult.
- I'm excited to play the rest of the campaigns. There's also an expansion and a few one-module micro expansions, I'll have to hunt those down later.
