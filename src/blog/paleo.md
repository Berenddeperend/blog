Yee haw pardners!

Prehistoric shenanigans. Eat dodo's, get eaten by wolves, and prioritize drawing a painting over producing offspring.

- Figuring out how to play the game with Pieter in Café België, just like we did with Mini Rogue. It was such a memorable night.
- Thematically the best game I've played yet. All cards resolve in a way that feels believable. For instance there's a card that leads you to the forest. You can collect one wood and the card will be shuffled back into the deck. Or if you have the right tools, you can cut down the trees and collect three wood, but the card will be lost.
- The crafting table is so cool. It's purely cosmetic but I appreciate it a lot.

- The resources are cozy as well.

- I've read that after a few games you really learn how to optimize the game and then it stops being fun. I could see that happening, but after playing 4 or 5 campaigns I still enjoy it a lot.
- It's probably a little too luck-dependant for seasoned board game players, but I don't consider myself one of them. 
- I've played it with two, three and four players. More players seems to make it more difficult.
- I'm excited to play the rest of the campaigns. There's also an expansion and a few one-module micro expansions, I'll have to hunt those down later.

## Update: 10 februari 2025

Hot damn this game is amazing. I'm buzzing with energy every time we complete a campaign. The 'a new beginning' expansion adds some lovely new mechanics.
Some highlights:

- In the base game you do what the game wants you to do, but with the expansion you now have different ways of getting there. A strategy I'd like to try is to get all of my food through farms instead of hunting.
- The time Mart, Koen and I scored our last victory point by building the stonehenge, just moments before we were about to lose. It is an alternative win condition that is not always possible or logical to go for, but for us it was the only way and it worked out.
