I like Everdell! Here are some thoughts:

- It looks beautiful. Everybody agrees on that, so let's get that one out of the way first.
- For such a physically large game, setup is surprisingly fast.
- My first worker placement game. It's a nice genre, I'm curious if there are other more lightweight variants on this game.
- Similar to other games, you'll probably go through an eco-boom phase and a point scoring phase. Figuring out when to shift is a tricky and fun.
- I've noticed that I often go for similar builds. My resources usually come from the farm + farmer and the shop + shopkeeper, but I'm eager to try out different approaches.
- The font on the mission cards (or whatever they're called) is absolutely horrible. Luckily it's just four cards per game that you need to read.
- The cardboard evertree is a little silly to me. It's similar to the workbench in Paleo, but less useful and not as cool.
- I don't like hyper-competitive or zero-sum games. This game hits the sweetspot in amount of player interaction. Each player does their own thing, occasionally claiming a card or resource another player wanted to go for. The cards with an 'open' spot gives a really nice dynamic as well. You only compare scores at the end and it's usually pretty close. 
- I've not played any of the expansions yet. I'm not yet sure if I want to expand Everdell or go for the standalone sequel Farshore.
- Ramon can't keep himself from stacking things.

My highscore so far is 80 points, in a 2 player game using just the base game.
I didn't take a picture, but here are some key plays that made it happen:

- I built a Chapel as early as I could.
- Every season, I placed my worker on the Chapel.
- I played the Ranger, to move my worker away from the Chapel so I could place another worker there. At his point I had 4 points on my Chapel.
- I then played the Shepherd to gain 4 points.
- I activated my University to get rid of the Sheperd, so I could play another Shepherd for 4 points
- Playing and graduating your Sheperd gives you a bunch of berries. I used them to play the Doctor for three points.
- I used the University to get rid of the Doctor and played him again. That's a lot of points!
- Activating the Chapel a bunch of times gives you a lot of cards. I used them with the Bard (5 points), and to swap them for resources to build the Ever Tree
- Last but not least, the Pristine Chapel Ceiling event was available, giving me another 8 points. 


Another cool play was Mart's first game:

- For about 90% of the game he was commenting about how he had no idea what he was doing. This was true, he had no real engine going on.
- He did however have the Cemetary and Undertaker card in play.
- For one of his final plays, he wanted to buy the Queen from the meadow for 5 berries.
- Instead, he took a gamble by placing a worker on the Cemetary. He got a Doctor, not great not terrible.
- He placed another worker on the Cemetary and got the Palace
- This allowed him to play the queen for free
- And he got six extra points because of the 'Remembering the fallen' special event card.
- He tied for first place after all that.
