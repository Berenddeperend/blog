Sadly, I think this will be the last entry. Our motivation to play the game has dwindled quite a bit, as can be seen from the frequency of these blogs. Today we finally gave it another shot after many months.
But unfortunately, everything we grew to dislike about this game came back in full effect:

- We played from 17:00 until 22:00. That is just too long.
- Maartje's previous character has retired, so her new lobsterboi was still at level 1. The enemies scaled accordingly but the damage she was able to do was negligible.
- The idea of the scenario (split up the party in teams of two and cross two bridges) was pretty cool, but since it's still generic cardboard tiles it didn't feel like a bridge. It really doesn't capture the imagination like Jaws or Paleo do.
- All the extra fluff (town building, bookkeeping, etc.) was still a major time sink with very little in return.

I've realized that I like Jaws of the Lion better in every way:

- Linear story line allows for a though-out story to be told. Frost is all over the place.
- Scenario-specific artwork through a foldable scenario book. Looks better and is easier to set up.
- Only four playable characters that synergize(?) nicely and level up together.
- Jaws has 25 campaings, which is plenty. Took us over a year to complete, 100+ campaingns in Frost is madness.

So now what? I still love our group and we're still excited about playing together, so we'll find something else to play.
Joost has Slay The Spire and Heat, we'll start with those. And in time, we might give another legacy-style game a try.

Cheers!
