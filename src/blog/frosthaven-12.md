This week we ran a marathon in scenario 9: **Glowing Catacombs**. Just look at how L O N G this bad boy is:

The background is that in the last campaign we discovered a path and this time we explored it. Scenario goal: kill err'thang.

Some highlights:

- We were introduced to Maartjes new character: **Krabmeneer!** I believe the name is still a work in progress. Its figurine is quite a chonker and it has some cool loot-grabbin' claws. Battle cry: "Ik maak sushi van je!"

- I can't remember a campaign where we had to cover this much ground. From the starting hex to my end hex I walked **31 tiles**. Not much of a problem for Blinkblade and Drifter with their 10-ish walk cards, but nearly undoable for my Buurman and Buurman. Lots of early short-rests to get back some cards with decent movement. I got some serious JotL Black Ship PTSD flashbacks. 

- Ramon did his awesome area-of-effect attack again and hit three enemies for 4, 6 and 10 damage. The 10 dmg-hit was the exact amount needed for a kill, very satisfying. Only of the enemies survived the attack with 1 HP remaining. Then the enemy attacked Ramon, drew a miss card and got killed by Ramons retaliate. Sucks to be him.

- I killed an Ooze with maximum overkill. It was poisoned and had 1 hp left, I hit my icebound Quills with +1 for consuming ice, +1 for Hornbeatle Caprece, and a 2x modifier. That's 16 dmg, **15 more** than needed. That moment made me realise that I need a battle cry as well. I'm open to suggestions.

- I misunderstood my battle goal and did the exact opposite. High initiative means a low number and vice versa which is a little confusing. We compromised and awarded me one checkmark.

I like to not take responsibility whenever I can so I blame this fuckup to our lack of *anti-eye fatigue* sleeves on the battle-goal cards.
