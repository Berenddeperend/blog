Mini Rogue is awesome! Easily in my top 3 favorites.

I bought this game for Pieter's birthday because Joost recommended it. I gave it to him in the pub and we started playing it there and then. Figuring out the rules together and finding strategies while having some Belgium beers was an absolute blast. It's nights like these that make life worth living.

Some thoughts about the game:

- This is the only game I'd describe as cozy. Using small wooden cubes to track xp, stonks, food etc. just feels nice.
- There is definitely a tier list in the characters. Some are just stronger than others (looking at you, wizard and skelly!). Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not communicated in any way. If it were, you could apply some balancing rules on top of it.
- The expansions are great.
- I love how portable it is! Not portable enough to fit in your pocket, but it'll easily fit in any backpack or even the pocket of my coat.
- Setting up takes just a little longer than I'd like. Not that it takes very long, but mostly because I've done it a LOT of times.
- The manual isn't great. I believe it even contradicts itself on one topic.
- Playing it solo is fun too!
