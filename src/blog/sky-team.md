Forget BoardGameGeek, Joost is all you need for your recommendations. He told me about Sky Team and it's a shot in the rose.

Pros:
- Love the theme! Toggling cardboard sliders is lovely.
- I taught multiple people to play the game, so I've played the first (and least interesting) campaign a lot of times. But since beginners make unpredictable mistakes, it's still fun and challenging!
- Short setup time, about 3 minutes.
- Short-ish play time, short enough for multiple games.
- Small footprint when set up, so you can play it at Molly Malone.

Cons:
- No bonus points for doing the cool stewardess choreography.
- Ditto for mile high club, or roleplaying as a suitcase.

Other thoughts:
- I bought the expansion at Spiel Essen 2024. Super cool to see how big the hype for this game was.
- I have these small plastic boxes with magnets that are perfect for the box.
