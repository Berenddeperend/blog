Delightful little game! I saw it from the corner of my eye at Comicasa and I was immediately intrigued.
I decided to buy it without looking up anything.

Here's our lil' hero on route to the final boss.

Full game setup. The sleeves make everything kinda shiny, I think I would have preferred matte sleeves.

Pros: 

- Great theme and artwork. The characters and spells are 8-bit, the rest of the artwork isn't. A very tasteful combination.

- I think the difficulty is spot on! Took me a few tries to beat it at first, but after I got a little better I beat it twice in a row.
- The 'double mode' is a nice addition. It just makes the game a little shorter.
- The decision-making process is deeper than you'd think! It feels like your decisions matter more in this game than they do in Mini Rogue, which is great.


Cons:
- The replayability is probably not great. I'd have loved a few more monsters/ability cards. I'd probably buy the expansion if they'd ever release one.
- I feel like traversing the map doesn't require a lot of thinking. Usually there's a best route available that doesn't differ much from game to game. 
- The manual wasn't the greatest. I missed the rule where you need to discard one of the cards in your hand, which made the game trivial. I later learned about this rule online, and noticed a lot of other players missed that too.
- In the 'component' section of the manual it tells you to discard one of the two princesses. That piece of info really belongs in the 'game setup' section, but it's not a big deal.
- It was a little hard to recognize which of the spell cards are part of your starter deck. The starter cards also have a half-opacity picture of their complementary cards. This only makes it confusing.
- I like the game for what it is, but I'd have loved a two-player variant. Mini Rogue has this and it made it so much more fun.


Other thoughts:

- The game came with complimentary sleeves. I don't normally sleeve my cards, but if it's free I will.
- It's funny how there's a Spanish version of a lot of the cards included. I threw them away.
