I bought this game after playing a few two-player games with my gym buddy Niek. The game really shines with three players or more. Fun fact: in the very first turn of my very first game I immediately won by playing the guard and correctly guessing Niek's card. I'm just that good.

Some thoughts:

- While it seems intimidating at first, the game is surprisingly easy to learn.
- Playable with two players but definitely more fun with 3 or more.
- The game is nice and portable, which is always a plus. Games are quick and it barely takes up any space at all.
- The packaging of the game is overkill. It's being overly fancy just to bump the price.
- I don't love that it comes in a satin bag. I'd have preferred cardboard.
- The theme of the game is the dumbest I've ever seen. You're supposedly trying to send a letter to the princess but the gameplay doesn't reflect that at all.
