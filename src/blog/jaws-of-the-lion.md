My all-time favorite. This was my first 'legacy' style game and man was it an experience. Playing this game with the same group for over a year at the same house made for great memories. I played as the Demolitionist and now I'm replaying it as the Voidwarden with a different group.
This was the first time I've experienced a board game with a theme, story, beautiful artwork and continuous progress.

Some pros:
- The game was about 50 euros, which is stupid cheap if you consider how many people got fun out of it. Our first playthrough alone took us 28 evenings * 3 hours * 4 players = 336 hours.
- I was already amazed by how much content there was, but the thingy you unlock after leveling up a few times took me by surprise.
- The friends I played it with at Noorderhagen <3


Some cons:
- The game comes with a million plastic bags. Joost was smart enough to invest in third party cardboard inlays, but it really should have been there from the beginning.
- As of june 2024, it seems like the game is no longer in stock anywhere? I hope they do a reprint someday, I'd love to own my own copy.
