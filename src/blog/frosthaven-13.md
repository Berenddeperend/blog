This week we did advanced triginometry in: **Radiant Forest**.

We built a submarine. But it needs an energy source which we set out to find this scenario. The goal: find and dig up three energy thingies.

Some highlights:

- One and a half hours of bookkeeping before starting the campaign. All the extra content of Frosthaven compared to Jaws is fun, but this is borderline too much. We might invest in a helper app or something.

- Before starting the scenario our town got attacked by algoxes! Luckily we were well-prepared and had recruited a bunch of guardbobs. What we didn't realise though, is that you have to sacrifice them if you want them to help. Which we gladly did, we threw three Bobs in the meat grinder and the algoxes didn't stand a chance.

- This scenario contained two rooms. In the first one Maartje, Joost and I got stuck in a moshpit with three Shrike Fiends. They all had pull three on three targets so we flew all over the map. The only one who remained safe was our Drifter Ramon, who could handle it the best.

- The second room went better. We felt more in control and had more luck. Ramon one-shotted a fire thingy who had 4 shield, because Ramon had two pierce.

- We were introduced to Earth Guys, who don't do much special except for having 18 hp. Which is great for my Thresh And Flail with Strength, causing me to do 13 dmg on a single target.

- Lobsterboy holding is one of my favorite things.
