Super nice! I was dying to try out this game and it didn't disappoint.

- Once you've learned the rules, it's a very simple game. Just roll the dice and assign the value as movement to your cars.
- Embrace the chaos, baby! You can make some informed decisions, but in the end the dice decide your fate.
- Getting eliminated doesn't feel unfair, since often times your attacker puts themselves at risk as well.
- I've not played with them yet, but I think the 'Extra Ammo' cards add so much to the replayability.
- After playing just one game, I bought the 'Carnage at Devil's run' expansion. According to BoardGameGeek, it's a must-have. Buying DLC that early goes a little against my principles, but I couldn't contain myself. The second game I played was also without the expansion and I can see how just the base game could get a little samey.
