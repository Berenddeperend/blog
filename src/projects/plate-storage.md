During Covid I bought 70kg worth of relatively cheap weights. For a while I had them stored in the hallway like this:

Not ideal. So I built this:

In order to protect the wood (and because I like overengineering), I made some holders as well. This was the general idea:

I modeled the holders for each of the weights, matching the exact radius of the plates.

Using my trusty Ender 3, I printed these:

When installed it looks something like this:
