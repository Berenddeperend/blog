I like to do pullups. Me and a few friends usually trained at an outdoor sports park nearby, but it was closed due to Covid. So I invested in a heavy duty, outdoor-proof pullup rack.

When I saw a post online of someone who converted his similar pullup rack to a squat rack, I knew what had to be done.
