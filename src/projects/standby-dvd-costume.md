With Covid almost behind us my friend Joost and his roommates gave a house party (don't worry, fully vaccinated and tested negative just before the event). The theme for the party was the letter 'D'. After thinking about it for a while I came up with the standby DVD-player screen. The cool thing is that I managed to incorporate many of my skills/interests into it, albeit at a basic level.

I constructed a simple wooden frame that I spraypainted silver:

I 3D-printed a Samsung logo:

I attached Erik's dev board to the frame. He configured it to act like a Bluetooth keyboard that I could connect to my phone:

I created and hosted a **[simple website](/dvd)** that shows the DVD logo as svg, and changes to a random color on every keypress.

Finally I attached my phone to my t-shirt. I did this by simply sandwiching my t-shirt between the phone and its case: 



That's it! Thanks for Erik for some help with brainstorming and Joost for the awesome party.
