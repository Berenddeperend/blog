Computer stuff

- 2014 15 inch base model MBP. Awesome machine, no stupid gimmicks like a touchbar. Still does a great job but does runs a bit hot when watching fullscreen Youtube videos or meetings. I'd love to upgrade to a M1 MacBook but it's not necessary and e-waste is something I do take seriously. 
- Keychron K2 with red switches. Awesome keyboard, typing on it is a delight. In hindsight I'd rather have gone with the K8. The K8 is only slightly bigger but has a more traditional tenkeyless layout, making switching to other keyboards easier.
- Logitech MX Master S2. Good mouse. A bit too heavy for my taste and I'm not a fan of OSX scroll acceleration, but you get used to it.
- Philips P-line 279P1/00. 27 inch 4k, usb-c. Nice.
- Raspberry Pi 3b. Hidden in a cabin. It's where I host this website with a Node + Express.js server.
- Synology DS218play with 2x 3TB in a mirror setup. Not sure what RAID that is. This machine is mostly fire-and-forget for me.

Workout stuff

- Decathlon barbell. Awesome thing, I still can't believe I have my own barbell.
- 70kg worth of (relatively) cheap cast-iron plates. I built a storage rack for them.
- Pullup bar. Love it.
- Homemade squat rack.
- Two cheap dumbbells.
- 10kg kettlebell, mainly for weighted pullups.
- Power Perfect 3 shoes. I have shitty ankle mobility so having a raised heel really helps.


Music stuff

- Fender Mexican Standard Telecaster. Still diggin' the color after a few years of owning it.
- Yamaha F310. Perfectly adequate cheap acoustic.
- Squire Affinity Jbass. Got it second hand, it's good enough for me
- Roland Cube 40. Perfect for someone of my skill level.
