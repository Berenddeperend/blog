Inspired by some facebook post. Seemed like a simple enough project and I already had all the required hardware laying around. 

Some first prototypes:

I was using the small servo motor in a pretty inefficient way so it wasn't strong enough.

Two servos:

Still not great. I ordered a slightly bigger servo and attached it:

The servo worked but the sensor was not in a good place. I fixed it with some popsicle sticks.

Success!

Used hardware: 
  - Arduino Duemilanove (Italian for "2009", so it's a pretty old one)
  - Ultrasonic distance sensor
  - S3003 Servo
  - Hot glue and scrap wood
