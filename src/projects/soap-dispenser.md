Inspired by some facebook post. Seemed like a simple enough project and I already had all the required laying around. 

Some first prototypes:



I was using the small servo motor in a pretty inefficient way so it wasn't strong enough.

Two servos:

  </video>



Still not great. I ordered a slightly bigger servo and attached it:


Success!


Used hardware: 
  - Arduino Duemilanove (Italian for "2009", so it's a pretty old one)
  - Ultrasonic distance sensor
  - S3003 Servo
