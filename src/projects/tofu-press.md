You're either complicit to murder or a vegetarian.
Now I ain't judging and I still eat meat myself, but killing a little is better than killing a lot.
So instead of eating a lot of chicken, I'm trying to switch to tofu for my source of protein. 
And as they say, tofu is like code: it's better when it's dry and you need to season it for it to not taste like wet tofu.

Since I can't use abstractions to dry my tofu, I built this press.

- Made from a plank I found in the shed.
- The iron hardware is from Hornbach, they have an excellent selection and you can buy them in any quantity.
- The slots were made with the router I got from my friends at my housewarming. The upper plank also has slots, that doesn't serve a purpose. 

The thing looks pretty dang bad but it works. Again, not unlike my code.

It's also definitely a step up from my previous solution, which was a plate on top of the tofu with weight plates on top of that.
I'll recreate it someday to take a picture.
