The bunny that's chilling next to me in the website header is Pip. I <del>stole</del> adopted her from my sister. She's an elderly Holland Lop that's mostly pretty calm and likes to stay on the carpet in my living room.

But once she got the confidence to explore beyond the borders of the carpet, my cables became endangered.

So I went out to build a fence to keep her from the cables. It's made out of leftover skirting boards and scrap wood.

I designed and 3d-printed some hinges for more flexibility in which areas to fence.

While it works great, but Pip seems determined to chew her way through. We'll see how often I need to reenforce the defences.
