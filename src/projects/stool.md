In September 2022 I joined a 12-week [woodworking course](https://cursushout.nl/cursussen/particulier/houtbewerking-1/). The first three weeks we practiced different types of joints, in the remaining nine weeks I built this stool. It took around 25 hours. The wood is 'grenenhout', which I believe is Scots Pine in English. It's made with [mortise and tenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortise_and_tenon) joints. I sawed, chiseled and sanded it by hand. A few exeptions:

- Some of the mortises were drilled with a horizontal drill press to save time.
- The lumber was prepared for us with machines. I don't know which ones, but the wood was perfectly square.
- The seat was also pre-made for us.
- The seat isn't glued to the frame, it's secured by four brackets that are screwed in the seat. It's a pretty clever technique that I wasn't aware of before.

Back at home I applied boiled linseed oil. It gave the wood a nice warm color and really made the grains pop.

I highly recommend the course to anyone in need of a new hobby. The folks over at CursusHout have been excellent. It's not cheap but well worth it in my opinion. Spend less on goods and more on services, y'all!
