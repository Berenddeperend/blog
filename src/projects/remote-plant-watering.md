title: Remote plant watering

summary: Plants, arduino, remote controller and a pump.

This was one of my earlier arduino projects. I started with connecting some soil moisture sensors to a plant.

Then I built a pretty crappy planter with the sensor built-in.

I wanted to do something more with this concept. I wanted a planter with a water compartiment and a pump, so I could water the plant without being there. These are some sketches:

I settled on this design:

{% image "plant-water/electronics.jpg", "Work in progress of electronics" %}
{% image "plant-water/final-1.jpg", "The finished product" %}

At TRIMM we have these green mugs everywhere. Whenever I wanted to get myself a cup of coffee, I could also get my planty boy a refill.

The goal was to have the thing wifi-connected, but I never made it past a prototype. I did hook it up to an infrared remote controller though, which worked pretty well.
