I built a jig that allows me to make very specific lap-joints with my router.

By coincidence it also looks a bit like the coat of arms of Enschede, the city I live in.

The context is that I want to sell mini picnick tables as a kit. I have all sorts of clamps and vices and angle guages, but I don't expect my customers to have them. That's why I strive for my designs to be fool-proof, with all the parts only fitting together in one way. Matthijs taught me this principle is called **Poka-Yoke**.

My design includes four cross lap joints. These are very easy to glue up and with tight enough tolerances, you'll always have the correct angle without any measuring equipment.

Because I plan to make a lot of these, I built this jig to help me make quick, precise and repeatable cuts.
