I already made a storage for my iron weight plates, but because I switched to olympic weightlifting I also bought bumper plates.
Time for a second thing!

Step one: Inherit this super cool workbench.

Chiseling out some square holes. It creates a cool looking pyramid inside.

I didn't take any pictures of cutting the tenon, but they came out like this.

I drilled the hole in the mortise with a accuboor. I clamped a piece of wood to the underside to prevent blowout.

Then some pins. They were a little too big, so I tapered them with a chisel to give them a nice wedge-shape.

It fits together like this:

It's called a 'tusked tenon joint', something I hadn't used before.

Do that three more times and you've got yourself a frame.

The plates don't touch the ground.

Fun fact, I used Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the distance between two pieces of wood! This might seem super obvious for some of you, but I was super surprised to realize that I finally found a real use case for something I learned about in high school.
