Joost asked me to build a picnic table for his nieces' first birthday. I have no idea how large children are, but we decided on a seat height of 26 cm and a top height of 46 cm.

I don't have many progress pictures, since a lot of it is just cutting planks to length on my crosscut saw.

Getting everything square when dry-fitting was quite challenging actually.
