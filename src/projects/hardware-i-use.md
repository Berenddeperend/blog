Inspired by [Wes](https://wesbos.com/uses), here's a list of some of the cool things I own

### Computer stuff 

- **2020 M1 MacBook Air (16 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD)**. Definitely the best laptop I've ever owned. It's passively cooled, fast, stays cool and has an amazing battery life. Pretty much all I could ask for. I do prefer the 15 inch screen of my old MacBook but I needed a new laptop and I was fed up with the fan noise needed to keep the Intel processor cool. At the time of writing, the 13 inch models were the only Apple Silicon laptops available.
- **Keychron K2** with red switches. Awesome keyboard, typing on it is a delight. In hindsight I'd rather have gone with the K8. The K8 is only slightly bigger but has a more traditional tenkeyless layout, making switching to other keyboards easier.
- **Logitech MX Master S2**. Good mouse. A bit too heavy for my taste and I'm not a fan of OSX scroll acceleration, but you get used to it. Its scrolling is awesome.
- **LG 27UL850-W** 4k 27 inch monitor. With just one usb-c cable I can take care of audio, video and charging. 
- **VS Code** is my editor of choice. 
- **Wacom Intuos 4 M**. I don't draw much any more, but it has served me well over the years.
- **Raspberry Pi 3b**. Hidden in a cabinet. It's where I host this website with a Node + Express.js server.
- **Synology DS218play** with 2x 3TB in a mirror setup. Not sure what RAID that is. This machine is mostly fire-and-forget for me.

### Tools

- **Parkside mitre saw**. I don't have it dialed in perfectly yet but it's a lot of fun to work with. Pretty scary too. It still feels somewhat wrong to use it unsupervised.
- **Ender 3 pro** 3D printer. I replaced the motherboard with a BigTreeTech board that has quiet motor drivers. The noises were driving me insane after a while so I fully recommend the upgrade. Creating and printing your own designs is extremely rewarding, and for 200-something euros it was definitely worth it for me. 

### Workout stuff

- Decathlon **barbell**. Awesome piece of metal, I still can't believe I have my own barbell.
- 70kg worth of (relatively) cheap cast-iron **plates**. I built a [storage rack]() for them.
- **Pullup bar**. Love it.
- Homemade **[squat rack]()**.
- Two cheap **dumbbells**.
- 10kg **kettlebell**, mainly for weighted pullups.
- **Power Perfect 3** shoes. I have shitty ankle mobility so having a raised heel really helps.

### Music stuff

- **Fender Mexican Standard Telecaster**. Still diggin' the color after a few years of owning it.
- **Yamaha F310**. A perfectly adequate cheap acoustic.
- **Squire Affinity Jbass**. Got it second hand, it's good enough for me. Rarely use it anymore as we stopped jamming during COVID.
- **Roland Cube 40**. Perfect for someone of my skill level.

### Transport

- **Azor Schouwen**. Inspired by the old 'path racer' bikes. Wooden fenders, leather seat and handles, upside down handlebars, two speed centrifugal transmission. That's right, after reaching a certain speed it automatically shifts gears. Not gonna lie, I shamelessly stole this configuration from my coworker Erik. It's hands down the coolest bike I've ever seen. 
- An old racebike I bought second hand from my friend Joost. My preferred choice for rides outside of the city.
- 2000-something **Honda Shadow 750 ACE**. Really cool motorcycle. Unfortunately I don't get to use it as much as I'd like, as I live in the city center and can't easily park it near my house.
