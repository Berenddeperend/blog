# Hello.

I'm Berend, a web developer from Enschede, the Netherlands. This website showcases some of the projects I've been working on in my spare time.

I like to dabble in woodworking, 3D-printing, guitar playing, IoT and powerlifting.

Other interests in which I don't actively partake include retro hardware (big fan of Youtube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uT9cgJorJPWu7ITLGo9Ww" target="_blank">the 8-Bit Guy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ" target="_blank">LGR</a>), birds, skateboarding and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRzQlQ7tAw" target="_blank">Sea Shanty 2</a> from Runescape.

You can reach me by <a href="mailto:berendswennenhuis@gmail.com">email</a> and find my code on <a href="https://github.com/berenddeperend/" target="_blank">Github</a>.
