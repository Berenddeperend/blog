# Hello.

I'm a frontend developer by day, and a frontend developer by night as well but asleep. My preferred technologies are Vuejs, TypeScript and SCSS. I live in Enschede, the Netherlands.

I like to dabble in woodworking, 3D-printing, guitar playing, IoT and fitness.

Other interests in which I don't actively partake include retro hardware (big fan of Youtube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uT9cgJorJPWu7ITLGo9Ww" target="_blank">the 8-Bit Guy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ" target="_blank">LGR</a>), birds, skateboarding and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRzQlQ7tAw" target="_blank">Sea Shanty 2</a> from Runescape.

Feel free to send me a <a href="mailto:berendswennenhuis@gmail.com">message</a> if you have any questions or ideas.
