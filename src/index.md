# Hello.

I'm Berend, a web developer from the Netherlands. I live in Enschede with my bunny Pip. This website showcases some of the projects I've been working on in my spare time.

My main hobbies are strength sports (<a href="/blog/powerlifting">powerlifting</a>/weightlifting), board games and woodworking. Some on-again, off-again activities I enjoy inlcude programming small games, 3D-printing, playing guitar and pen plotting.

Other interests in which I don't actively partake include retro hardware, birds, skateboarding and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRzQlQ7tAw" target="_blank">Sea Shanty 2</a> from Runescape.

You can reach me by <a href="mailto:berendswennenhuis@gmail.com">email</a> and find my code on <a href="https://github.com/berenddeperend/" target="_blank">Github</a>.

Quick links to games I wrote: <a href="/tetris" target="_blank">Tetris</a>, <a href="/nonogram" target="_blank">Nonogram With Friends</a>
