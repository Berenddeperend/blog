<p>This week we took a magical elevator that hates Ramon in scenario 24: <strong>Upper Spire</strong>.</p>
<p>It was a really cool campaign full of extremes. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I managed to target three enemies with my Firefly Swarm with the Hornbeetle Carapace active while consuming fire. A lot of silly words, but it means that I hit a 7, 6, and 8 for a combined <strong>21 damage</strong>. Beautiful!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Chaos Demons were angry with me today! One of them hit me for a 6, then a 5. As revenge, I one-shotted him for 16 damage, while also completing my battle goal. <em><strong>Bonk.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/bonk.jpeg" width="1000" height="1333">
<ul>
<li>We fought some skeletons and they were pretty useless. In one round, three of them tried to hit us and they all hit zeroes. Two curses and a miss, I believe. Skellyboiiii!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A Wind Demon had three shield at some point, which is a pain to deal with. Luckily our comrad Bob was standing exactly where he should be, so Maartje could attack with three pierce damage. I don't know why but there's something very satisfying about having just enough pierce damage &lt;3</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Joost <em><strong>granted</strong></em> walk?!! We were highly sceptical but there was no catch. Still can't believe it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of Joost, he had the absolute craziest luck that evening. Due to scenario effects and circumstances he had 4 extra curses and 2 extra blesses in his deck. He somehow managed to only draw 2x modifiers and zero x0 modifiers. This resulted in a few beautiful moves. He exactly one-shotted a few monsters, but also did 16 damage on an enemy who was already wounded, poisoned, and on 1 HP. Oh, <em>he dea!</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/overkill.jpeg" width="1000" height="1333">
<ul>
<li>Ramon was less lucky. We took a magical elevator that gives you a random effect (positive or negative) every time you enter. Ramon took trap damage from it twice. That's a 1 in 144 chance. The third time he entered he got wounded. Better take the stairs next time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was it! Next episode will be in a month because my friends have a life. How dare they.</p>
