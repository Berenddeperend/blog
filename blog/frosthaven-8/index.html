<p>Finally! Everyone is done with their silly holidays so after 1,5 months we're finally back in business. I really missed it and I'm grateful to be playing again. We had our pasta salad with pezza pisto and were ready to start scenario 15: <strong>Ancient Spire</strong>.</p>
<p>Backstory: apparently we saw a peak on some map and decided to slip into a factory. Maartje, Ramon and I picked a fight with some arrow-shootin' pyramid crab robots while Joost snuck out to defeat their leader, the Chaos Lieutenant (who has a way higher voice than you'd think).</p>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/scenario-15.jpeg" width="1000" height="750">
<p>It turned out to be a pretty quick campaign, but a fun one nonetheless. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone got their perk! Maartje, Ramon and Joost picked the battle goal that best suited their play style this campaign. I got lucky when the final enemy spawned every element at once, which was exactly what I needed.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/ritualist-perk.jpeg" width="1000" height="1332">
<ul>
<li>By playing my Venomous Barbs with disarm (top) and the Hornbeetle Carapace with ice (bottom) I became the ultimate 'come at me bro'-tank. Spank me and you'll get spanked. I've dreamed of playing this exact combo for a while but it's extremely situational. Your position and initiative needs to be just right, and even then it'll still fail if the enemies don't attack. But this evening the stars aligned and it was beautiful. All six enemies tried to attack me and they all received 3 retaliation damage. That's a whopping <strong>18</strong> damage total, more than I ever managed to do even as a level 9 Demolitionist in Jaws. And because I had two shield I only took 2 damage in the process. I also gained a sweet 7 experience. This might be my most satisfying round to date.</li>
</ul>

<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/retaliate-2.jpeg" width="1000" height="1332">
<ul>
<li>Banner Spear Maartje got extra campy by completing both her mastery (always stay within two hexes of her banner) and her perk (never move more than two hexes per turn). She also invited her ally Bob to the party but he got spanked for one damage and died. Luckily Bob isn't a lost card so he got ressurected and got to see the campaign through. Bob is a cool guy, I hope to see him more often.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/maartje-bob-banner.jpeg" width="1000" height="1332">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It only took Joost two hits to kill the 14 hp Chaos Lieutenant. Impressive!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drifter Ramon only attacked twice this campaign and killed his enemy both times. That's knuppelefficiency if I've ever seen it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some lowlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joost can have extremely fast initiative as the Blinkblade, but twice his enemy was even faster. As in 1 initiative against Joost's 2. Because of that, he didn't manage to get the treasure chest in the back of the control room. I doubt he'll ever get over it. Give him a hug when you see him.</li>
</ul>
