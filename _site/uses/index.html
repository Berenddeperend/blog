<p>Computer stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>2014 15 inch base model MBP. Awesome machine, no stupid gimmicks like a touchbar. Still does a great job but does runs a bit hot when watching fullscreen Youtube videos or meetings. I'd love to upgrade to a M1 MacBook but it's not necessary and e-waste is something I do take seriously.</li>
<li>Keychron K2 with red switches. Awesome keyboard, typing on it is a delight. In hindsight I'd rather have gone with the K8. The K8 is only slightly bigger but has a more traditional tenkeyless layout, making switching to other keyboards easier.</li>
<li>Logitech MX Master S2. Good mouse. A bit too heavy for my taste and I'm not a fan of OSX scroll acceleration, but you get used to it.</li>
<li>Philips P-line 279P1/00. 27 inch 4k, usb-c. Nice.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi 3b. Hidden in a cabin. It's where I host this website with a Node + Express.js server.</li>
<li>Synology DS218play with 2x 3TB in a mirror setup. Not sure what RAID that is. This machine is mostly fire-and-forget for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workout stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Decathlon barbell. Awesome thing, I still can't believe I have my own barbell.</li>
<li>70kg worth of (relatively) cheap cast-iron plates. I built a storage rack for them.</li>
<li>Pullup bar. Love it.</li>
<li>Homemade squat rack.</li>
<li>Two cheap dumbbells.</li>
<li>10kg kettlebell, mainly for weighted pullups.</li>
<li>Power Perfect 3 shoes. I have shitty ankle mobility so having a raised heel really helps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Music stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Fender Mexican Standard Telecaster. Still diggin' the color after a few years of owning it.</li>
<li>Yamaha F310. Perfectly adequate cheap acoustic.</li>
<li>Squire Affinity Jbass. Got it second hand, it's good enough for me</li>
<li>Roland Cube 40. Perfect for someone of my skill level.</li>
</ul>
