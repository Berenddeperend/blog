## Jaws of the lion
My all-time favorite. This was my first 'legacy' style game and man was it an experience.

## Frosthaven
It's jaws but turned to eleven. Which in some aspects is a good thing, but I actually prefer Jaws. 
Some pros:
    - Cool new character twists
    - New status effects (bane, regenerate), rolling modifiers,  
Some cons
    - the non-gameplay loop is too long
    - The story feels all over the place because it's non-linear. 
    - cardboard generic map tiles are not as cool as Jaws' campaign-specific prints
    - 


## Azul
Nice! Looks beautiful. Not too eventful tho. No need to pre-calculate everything which I like.

## Patchwork
I like that its dedicated two players. I dont like the artwork, a pet peeve of mine is colors that are hard to distinguish

## Dungeon mayhem
Absolute classic. The novelty has worn of a bit but I thurrouwhly enjoyed both the base game and the expantion. 

## Kwakzalvers
Good replayability! Some prechosen builds feel broken tho which is a bit weird. Box is annoyingly big. Game duration is spot-on
