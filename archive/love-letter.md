I bought this game after playing a few two-player games with my gym buddy Niek. Fun fact: in the very first turn of my very first game I immidiately won by playing the guard and correctly guessing Niek's card.

Some thoughts:

- While it seems intimidating at first, the game is surprisingly easy to learn.
- The game is nice and portable, which is always a plus
- The packaging of the game is overkill. It's being overly fancy just to bump the price.
- I don't love that it comes in a satin bag. I'd have preferred cardboard.
