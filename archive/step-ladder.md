I'd lend you my step ladder<br />

My second project at the woodworking course is a step ladder. I get to use the same principles I used for my <a href="/projects/stool" target="_blank">stool</a>, but next level. 

I started with the back frame. It consists of mortise and tenon joints and halfhoutse dovetails.

The dovetails were new for me. We have a few chisels that are grinded in exact 10 degree angles. This was a lot of fun.

The trickiest part about the back frame is that there's a cross within. It forces your angles to be exactly square, giving you far smaller tolerances. It's placed within the frame with angled mortise and tenon joints.

Next up was making the steps. First I cut and chisled out some dedos with a bovenschaaf.

Then I made the steps. They are just planks with one edge planed in an angle so that they lay flush in the frame.
