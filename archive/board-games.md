I like board games. Here are some that I have opinions about.

## Jaws of the lion
My all-time favorite. This was my first 'legacy' style game and man was it an experience. Playing this game with the same group for over a year at the same house made for great memories. I played as the Demolitionist and now I'm replaying it as the Voidwarden.
This was the first time I've experienced a board game with a theme, story, beautiful artwork and continuous progress.

## Frosthaven
Like Jaws but turned up to eleven. Which in some aspects is a good thing, but I actually prefer Jaws. 

Some pros:
- Cool new characters
- New status effects (bane, regenerate), rolling modifiers.
- New story branches are often unlockable by building a new vehicle, like a sled or boat. This is a really neat concept.

Some cons:
- The non-gameplay loop is too long. Resolving loot, road events, outpost events, base building, etc. This can easily take an hour after a scenario.
- The story feels all over the place because it's non-linear. 
- cardboard generic map tiles are not as cool as Jaws' campaign-specific prints.

    
## Azul
Nice! Looks beautiful. Often not too eventful tho. No need to pre-calculate every move you're about to make which I like. I'm more of a 'play by feel' kind of guy.

## Patchwork
I like that it's two players only. Most games can be played by two players but are way more fun with 3 or 4. I don't like the artwork, a pet peeve of mine is colors that are hard to distinguish. Other games that are guilty are Quacks and Pandemic. The size of the box and the game duration are good.

## Dungeon mayhem
Absolute classic. The novelty has worn of a bit but I thoroughly enjoyed both the base game and the expansion. The 12 euro base game must have been the best value for money I've ever gotten out of a game. I brought the game with me to a holiday to Berlin and we played it in every biergarten we found. When we weren't playing, we were discussing strategies. The expansion is fun as well, but a little less balanced and simple.

## Kwakzalvers (The Quacks of Quedlinburg)
Great game with amazing replayability. No two games are ever the same. Some prechosen builds feel broken tho which is a bit weird. The box is a bit cumbersome, which is a bit of a shame since I often bring games with me. Game duration is spot-on. The 6-value pumpkins of the expension make them viable.

## Pandemic legacy
It pains me to say that I didn't enjoy this one. I played it for six campaigns before making the decision to quit. Which is a shame because I really liked the group. The unlockables were cool and I'm somewhat curious about the content I didn't get to see, but the game just wasn't fun.
It never feels like you're winning. If you're playing it right, it just feels like you're not losing as bad. 
It wasn't too engaging to me because all the information was public. Even if it was your turn, someone else probably had a better idea of what you should do. Roan taught me that there was a word for this: 'quarter backing'.
I played it with four players, which might make these problems worse. I suspect the game is better with two or three players.

## Mini Rogue
Really cool game.! The only board game I've ever bothered to played solo as well. Some characters are too easy tho (wizard, rogue). This is the only game I'd describe as cozy. Using small wooden cubes to trank xp, stonks, food etc. just feels nice. Setup doesn't take too long, but since I've played dozens of games my patience does wear a bit thin.

## Elfenland
Like Ticket To Ride but outdated and more fun. Can be played with up to 5 players, and more players is more fun. Pony on, cowboy! The Elfenland t-shirt is still high on my wish list.

## Loveletters
Very easy to learn which is always good. Also super compact, which is a plus.
